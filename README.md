The anonymous presentation of the Top10 most memorized samples for paper : MultiMem: Quantifying and Mitigating Memorization in Multi-Modal Models


The TOP10 most memorized samples for VideoCLIP are presented in folder VideoCLIP_top10

We observe that all of these samples contain captions that are misaligned with the corresponding videos. A common pattern is the presence of vague or generic phrases such as “footage from a TV show” or “clip of a movie,” which carry little semantic information.\



The TOP10 most memorized samples for AVT are presented in folder AVTCLIP_top10

As discussed in the main text, these samples exhibit semantic misalignment not only between the caption and the video, but across all modality pairs, indicating a broader cross-modal inconsistency rather than simple miscaptioning.
